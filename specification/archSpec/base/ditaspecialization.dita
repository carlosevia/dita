  <title>Overview of DITA extension facilities</title>
  <shortdesc rev="2.0">DITA provides three extension facilities: Document-type configuration,
    specialization, and element-type configuration. In addition, generalization can be applied to
    reverse specialization.</shortdesc>

        <dd><ph rev="2.0">Document-type configuration</ph> enables the definition of DITA document
          types that include only the vocabulary modules that are required for a given set of
          documents. There is no need to modify the vocabulary modules. <ph rev="2.0">Document-type
            configurations</ph> are implemented as document-type shells.</dd>

        <dt>Specialization</dt>
        <dd>Specialization enables the creation of new element types in a way that preserves the
          ability to interchange those new element types with conforming DITA applications.
          Specializations are implemented as vocabulary modules, which are integrated into
          document-type shells.<p>Specializations declare the elements and entities that are unique
            to a specialization. The separation of the vocabulary and its declarations into modules
            makes it easy to extend existing modules, because new modules can be added without
            affecting existing document types. It also makes it easy to assemble elements from
            different sources into a single document-type shell and to reuse specific parts of the
            specialization hierarchy in more than one document-type shell.</p></dd>

        <dd>
          <p>Element-type configuration enables DITA architects to modify the content models and
            attribute lists for individual elements, without modifying the vocabulary modules in
            which the elements are defined.</p>
          <p>There are two types of element configuration: Constraint and expansion. Both constraint
            and expansion are implemented as modules that are integrated into document-type
            shells:</p>
