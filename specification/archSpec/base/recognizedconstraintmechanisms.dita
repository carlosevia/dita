  <title>Recognized XML-document grammar mechanisms</title>
  <shortdesc>Conforming DITA document types and vocabulary modules can be constructed using several
    XML document-grammar mechanisms. The DITA specification provides coding requirements for DTDs
    and RNG; it also includes grammar files constructed using those mechanisms.</shortdesc>

    <p>Of these document-grammar mechanisms, RELAX NG grammars offer the easiest-to-use syntax and
      the most precise constraints. For this reason, the RELAX NG definitions of the standard DITA
      vocabularies are the normative versions.</p>
