 <title>DITAVAL-reference domain element</title>
 <shortdesc>The DITAVAL reference domain is used to reference a DITAVAL file that contains
  conditions that apply only to a subset of a DITA map. It also can be used to replicate a subset of
  a DITA map for multiple audiences.<draft-comment author="robander">The child topics here all refer
   to a "map branch implied by a ditavalref" – we should probably define "implied" as a term in this
   case, that we can easily refer to (or if we already define it, uses of the phrase "implied by a
   ditavalref" should link there).</draft-comment></shortdesc>
