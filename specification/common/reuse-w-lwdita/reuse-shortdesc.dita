        <p>When present in maps, the <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element is associated with
            <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> elements. This enables map authors to accomplish the
          following goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Associate a short description with a non-DITA object.</li>
          <li>Provide a short description that is specific to the map context and used for link
            previews.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element applies to an entire DITA map, it
          serves as description only.</p>
